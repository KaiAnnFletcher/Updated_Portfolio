        <h2><b>Background</b></h2>

<br>

<p>Before I jump into what this portfolio is all about, I would like to share a little bit about myself. 
I attended the University of Toronto's Scarborough campus for four years while pursuing an undergraduate 
double-major degree in Biochemistry and Neuroscience.</p>

<p>Programming was always more of a hobby/pastime for me before I decided that I wanted to apply it more 
seriously. I then switched jobs and now I provide product support for an expense management software application. 
Soon after that I decided to enroll in a 6-month intensive course for full-stack development at 
the University of Toronto! Since then, I have learned so much more than I ever would have on my own! 
Taking this course led to the creation of this portfolio which I will talk more about below.</p><br>

<h2><b>This Portfolio</b></h2>

<br>

<p>As I stressed previously, taking this course has been quite the learning experience. 
As a result, there are a lot of projects in this portfolio that are far from perfect or complete.
However, the best part of this experience is that with the more you learn, the more improvements 
you can commit to those ongoing projects - and this is what I have been progressively doing.</p>

<p>When I first started, I truly wanted it to be a learning experience, so much of my work was less than perfect.
However, I already feel a significant difference in my general approach to programming and troubleshooting compared to
several months ago when we were basically at the starting line - and this is what truly matters to me. It's not all about having a perfect
portfolio from the start, but rather seeing and reflecting on the imperfections as you go along while working toward improvements that facilitate 
the learning process!</p>

<p>Despite the imperfections, I am very proud of my portfolio and will continue to work toward building new projects while improving the existing ones!
Please see my contact page for more information and if you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out. Ideas and suggestions are most welcome! 
Thank you for visiting!</p>
